  <h2 id="what-is-odin">What is Odin?</h2>

  <p>
    Odin is a CLI-based platform designed to accelerate and streamline the software development
    lifecycle, improving developer velocity and experience. It solves for deployment and
    distribution, with a roadmap to provide end-to-end tooling including continuous integration,
    scaling, and monitoring.
  </p>

  <p>
    Odin wraps deployment APIs in an ergonomic CLI experience with simple configuration, rich status
    output, and automation-friendly responses. It manages services, environments, and deployments
    across cloud providers with guaranteed consistency.
  </p>

  <Callout type="note">

  <h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Environment Parity for EC2 and K8s</strong>: Minimal and easy-to-understand DSL to
      define services that works across platforms
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Service as Functional Unit</strong>: Defined boundaries with a set of components which
      can be treated as blackbox
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Versioning</strong>: All services/components are versioned in Odin and are immutable
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consistent and Guaranteed Deployment</strong>: Safe guards for production workloads
      with validation and rollback
    </li>
    <li><strong>Multiple Profiles</strong>: Manage multiple backend environments and switch between them easily</li>
    <li><strong>Rich Output Formats</strong>: Human-readable tables or JSON for automation</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Component Lifecycle Management</strong>: Deploy, undeploy, scale, and operate
      components independently
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Environment Management</strong>: Create, list, describe, and delete environments
      across cloud provider accounts
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Real-time Status</strong>: Inspect deployment status at service and component level
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="architecture-components">Architecture Components</h2>

  <p>Odin consists of several key components:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Odin CLI</strong>: Command-line interface for managing services and environments</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Deployer</strong>: Backend service that orchestrates deployment tasks using gRPC/REST
      APIs
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Orchestrator</strong>: Manages the lifecycle of deployment jobs and coordinates
      workflow execution
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Account Manager</strong>: Manages cloud provider credentials and access control
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Discovery Service</strong>: Provides service registration and discovery for
      distributed components
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="sdlc-with-odin">SDLC with Odin</h2>

  <p>Odin provides versioning to help you maintain immutable and mutable versions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Mutable Versions (SNAPSHOT)</strong>: Suffixed with <code>SNAPSHOT</code> for faster
      deployment during development and QA iterations
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Immutable Versions (CONCRETE)</strong>: Released versions that create immutable
      artifacts for production use
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Typical Workflow:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Development</strong>: Deploy services with <code>SNAPSHOT</code> version using JSON files</li>
    <li><strong>QA Iteration</strong>: Pass on to QA team for testing and iterate quickly</li>
    <li><strong>Release</strong>: Once ready, release the service with <code>CONCRETE</code> version</li>
    <li><strong>Production</strong>: Deploy the immutable artifact that can be used by others</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="when-to-use-odin">When to use Odin?</h2>

  <p>Odin is ideal for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Multi-Environment Deployments</strong>: Manage dev, staging, and production
      environments consistently
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Microservices Architecture</strong>: Deploy and manage services with multiple
      components and dependencies
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cloud-Native Applications</strong>: Deploy across EC2 and Kubernetes seamlessly
    </li>
    <li><strong>DevOps Teams</strong>: Streamline deployment workflows with CLI automation</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Safe Production Deploys</strong>: Built-in validation and confirmation for critical
      environments
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Component Lifecycle Management</strong>: Add, remove, or update components dynamically
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Audit and Compliance</strong>: Track all deployments with versioning and task history
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Odin is designed for teams that need consistent, reliable deployments across multiple
    environments and platforms.
