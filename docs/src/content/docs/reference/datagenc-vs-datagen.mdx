description: Understanding the differences between the compiler and encoded binaries
---

datagen provides two binaries for different use cases. Understanding when to use each one will help you choose the right tool for your workflow.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | datagenc (Compiler) | datagen (Encoded) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Input** | Requires `.dg` file paths | No paths needed |
| **Models** | Reads from filesystem | Embedded in binary |
| **Transpilation** | Yes, every run | No, pre-compiled |
| **Speed** | Slower (transpile + run) | Faster (run only) |
| **Use Case** | Development, testing | Production, deployment |
| **Distribution** | Need source files | Single binary |
| **Model Updates** | Immediate | Requires rebuild |

## Decision Guide

### Choose `datagenc` if:

- You're actively developing models
- You need quick iteration cycles
- Models change frequently

### Choose `datagen` if:

- Models are stable and finalized
- You want simple distribution
