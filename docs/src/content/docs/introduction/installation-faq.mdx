## General Questions

**Q: What is the minimum Kubernetes version required?**

A: Kubernetes v1.30 or later. Versions 1.30-1.34 are tested and recommended.

**Q: Can I install Odin on Minikube?**

A: Yes, but Kind is recommended for local development. Minikube may require additional memory configuration.

**Q: How much does Odin cost?**

A: Odin is open-source and free to use under the MIT License. You only pay for the infrastructure it runs on.

## Installation Questions

**Q: Can I use external databases instead of internal ones?**

A: Yes! You can configure external MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch:

```yaml
mysql:
  external:
    enabled: true
    master:
      host: "your-rds-endpoint.com"
redis:
  external:
    enabled: true
    host: "your-redis-endpoint.com"
elasticsearch:
  external:
    enabled: true
    host: "your-es-endpoint.com"
```

**Q: How do I customize resource allocations?**

A: Create a custom values file:

```yaml
deployer:
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 1Gi
    limits:
      cpu: 2
      memory: 4Gi
```

Then install with: `./install.sh --values custom-values.yaml`

## Configuration Questions

**Q: What are ES256 keys and why are they required?**

A: ES256 (ECDSA with P-256 curve and SHA-256) keys are used for secure authentication between components. They're automatically generated during installation or you can provide your own.


**Q: How do I enable high availability?**

A: Increase replica counts in your values file:

```yaml
deployer:
  replicaCount: 3
accountManager:
  replicaCount: 2
mysql:
  mysql:
    size: 3
redis:
  architecture: replication
  master:
    count: 1
  replica:
    replicaCount: 2
```

## Cloud-Specific Questions

**Q: Can I install on EKS/GKE/AKS?**

A: Yes! Odin works on all major cloud Kubernetes platforms.


**Q: How do I expose Odin externally?**

A: Use Kubernetes Ingress or LoadBalancer:

```yaml
deployer:
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer  # or configure Ingress
```

## Operational Questions

**Q: How do I backup Odin data?**

A: Enable automated backups for MySQL:

```yaml
mysql:
  backup:
    enabled: true
    schedule:
      - name: "daily-backup"
        schedule: "0 2 * * *"
        keep: 7
        storageName: s3local
```

Backups are stored in MinIO (`odin-backup-bucket`).

**Q: How do I upgrade Odin?**

A: Use Helm upgrade:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade odin odin/odin -n odin --values your-values.yaml
```

For major version upgrades, always review the release notes and backup your data first.

**Q: How do I completely remove Odin?**

A: See the [Installation Guide](/odin/introduction/getting-started/) for uninstallation instructions.
