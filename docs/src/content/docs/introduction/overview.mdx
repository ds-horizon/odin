## What is Odin?

Odin is a CLI-based platform designed to accelerate and streamline the software development lifecycle, improving developer velocity and experience. It solves for deployment and distribution, with a roadmap to provide end-to-end tooling including continuous integration, scaling, and monitoring.

Odin wraps deployment APIs in an ergonomic CLI experience with simple configuration, rich status output, and automation-friendly responses. It manages services, environments, and deployments across cloud providers with guaranteed consistency.

## Key Features

* **Environment Parity for EC2 and K8s**: Minimal and easy-to-understand DSL to define services that works across platforms
* **Service as Functional Unit**: Defined boundaries with a set of components which can be treated as blackbox
* **Versioning**: All services/components are versioned in Odin and are immutable
* **Consistent and Guaranteed Deployment**: Safe guards for production workloads with validation and rollback
* **Multiple Profiles**: Manage multiple backend environments and switch between them easily
* **Rich Output Formats**: Human-readable tables or JSON for automation
* **Component Lifecycle Management**: Deploy, undeploy, scale, and operate components independently
* **Environment Management**: Create, list, describe, and delete environments across cloud provider accounts
* **Real-time Status**: Inspect deployment status at service and component level

## Architecture Components

Odin consists of several key components:

* **Odin CLI**: Command-line interface for managing services and environments
* **Deployer**: Backend service that orchestrates deployment tasks using gRPC/REST APIs
* **Orchestrator**: Manages the lifecycle of deployment jobs and coordinates workflow execution
* **Account Manager**: Manages cloud provider credentials and access control
* **Discovery Service**: Provides service registration and discovery for distributed components

## SDLC with Odin

Odin provides versioning to help you maintain immutable and mutable versions:

* **Mutable Versions (SNAPSHOT)**: Suffixed with `SNAPSHOT` for faster deployment during development and QA iterations
* **Immutable Versions (CONCRETE)**: Released versions that create immutable artifacts for production use

**Typical Workflow:**

1. **Development**: Deploy services with `SNAPSHOT` version using JSON files
2. **QA Iteration**: Pass on to QA team for testing and iterate quickly
3. **Release**: Once ready, release the service with `CONCRETE` version
4. **Production**: Deploy the immutable artifact that can be used by others

## When to use Odin?

Odin is ideal for:

* **Multi-Environment Deployments**: Manage dev, staging, and production environments consistently
* **Microservices Architecture**: Deploy and manage services with multiple components and dependencies
* **Cloud-Native Applications**: Deploy across EC2 and Kubernetes seamlessly
* **DevOps Teams**: Streamline deployment workflows with CLI automation
* **Safe Production Deploys**: Built-in validation and confirmation for critical environments
* **Component Lifecycle Management**: Add, remove, or update components dynamically
* **Audit and Compliance**: Track all deployments with versioning and task history

Odin is designed for teams that need consistent, reliable deployments across multiple environments and platforms.
