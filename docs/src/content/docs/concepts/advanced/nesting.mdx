## Nesting models in directories

As your collection of datagen models grows, you can organize them into nested directory structures. This allows you to:

- **Namespace your models** - Avoid naming conflicts by organizing models in separate directories
- **Group related models** - Structure models by service, domain, feature, or any criteria that suits your needs
- **Maintain clarity** - Keep large codebases organized and easier to navigate

You are free to organize your directories however you wish. For example, you might structure them by:
- Services or microservices
- Database schemas
- Business domains
- Features or modules

### Example structure

Consider organizing models by service, where each service has its own set of tables:

```bash
models/
├── serviceA/
│   ├── tableA.dg
│   ├── tableB.dg
│   └── tableC.dg
└── serviceB/
    ├── tableA.dg
    ├── tableD.dg
    └── tableE.dg
```

### Referencing nested models

When referencing models in nested directories, use the fully qualified path:

```
self.datagen.<directory>.<model>().<field>()
```

For the structure above:
- To refer to `tableB` in `serviceA`: `self.datagen.serviceA.tableB().<column>()`
- To refer to `tableD` in `serviceB`: `self.datagen.serviceB.tableD().<column>()`

:::note
Notice that both `serviceA` and `serviceB` have a model named `tableA`. This is perfectly fine because they are accessed via their fully qualified paths, so there's no confusion about which model is being referenced.
:::

All paths are relative to the root models directory you provide to datagen.

## Running datagen with nested directories

:::caution[Important]
When running `datagen` with nested directory structures, you **must provide the root directory** as input, not individual subdirectories.
:::

For example, if your models are organized as shown above:

```bash
# Correct - provide the root directory
datagen -d ./models -o output

# Incorrect - providing subdirectories will cause errors
datagen -d ./models/serviceA -o output
datagen -d ./models/serviceB -o output
```

Providing individual subdirectories like `serviceA` or `serviceB` will cause data generation errors, especially when models reference each other across directories using `self.datagen` paths.
