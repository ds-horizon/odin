description: Overview of advanced datagen features and patterns
---

Once you're comfortable with the basics of datagen models, you can leverage advanced features to achieve more sophisticated and powerful data generation.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers advanced topics that will help you:

- **Configure and organize models** using metadata and custom Go code
- **Generate sequential and indexed data** with the `iter` variable
- **Create parameterized fields** using the `calls` section
- **Build relationships between models** using `self.datagen` references

## Topics

### Optional Model Sections

Learn how to use `metadata` and `misc` sections to configure your models and inject custom Go code.

**Key features:**
- Set default record counts
- Organize models with tags
- Define custom types and constants
- Write helper functions

[Go to Optional Sections →](/datagen/concepts/advanced/optional-sections)

### The `iter` Variable

Master the built-in `iter` variable to generate sequential, indexed, and pattern-based data.

**Use cases:**
- Generate sequential IDs
- Create batches of records
- Implement alternating patterns
- Build index-based logic

### Function Calls

Understand how to parameterize field generators using the `calls` section.

**Learn about:**
- Parameterized field syntax
- Providing arguments in calls
- Argument evaluation and reuse

[Go to Function Calls →](/datagen/concepts/advanced/function-calls)

### Model References

Create relationships between models using `self` and `self.datagen` references.

**Build:**
- Same-model references
- Cross-model relationships
- Complex multi-model dependencies
- Realistic foreign key relationships

### Nesting models in directories

You can nest models in directories to namespace them, according to services for example.
