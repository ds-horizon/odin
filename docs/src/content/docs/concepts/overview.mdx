Welcome to Odin's key concepts guide. This section introduces the fundamental building blocks of the Odin platform.

## Core Concepts

Odin is built around several key concepts that work together to provide a consistent deployment experience:

### [Environment](/odin/concepts/environment)

An isolated namespace for deploying services. Environments represent different stages of your development lifecycle (dev, staging, production) and are tied to one or more cloud provider accounts.

### [Service](/odin/concepts/service)

A deployable application unit composed of one or more components. Services are versioned and define the complete structure of your application including all its dependencies.

### [Component](/odin/concepts/component)

A building block of a service (e.g., web server, database, cache). Components have types, versions, configurations, and can depend on other components.

### [Provisioning](/odin/concepts/provisioning)

The configuration that defines **how** and **where** components are deployed. Provisioning configs map components to cloud provider resources (Kubernetes deployments, RDS instances, etc.).

## Workflow Overview

Here's how these concepts work together in a typical Odin workflow:

1. **Create Environment**: Set up an isolated environment for your services
2. **Define Service**: Describe your application and its components
3. **Configure Provisioning**: Specify how components should be deployed
4. **Deploy Service**: Execute the deployment
5. **Operate**: Manage, scale, and update your services and components
6. **Monitor**: Check status and health of your deployments
